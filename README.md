## My process

### Built with

- Plain HTML and CSS, featuring use of
  - CSS variables
  - CSS flexbox (as always lol)
  - CSS @media for width adjustment for mobile

### What I learned

I did some additional reading on variable fonts following on with from the last exercise. I was interested in the rational of providing variable fonts and static fonts. I considered adding references to both with @font-face and using the static fonts as a back-up. But I realised that this makes the use of variable fonts redundant as we don't save anything in terms of file download optimisation. I suppose you could just use one style of static font to replace multiple style usages of a variable font. But perhaps in real life it's better to just use standard fonts as a back up for failed variable font download.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
